### Description

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Iterator pattern lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an iterator.
