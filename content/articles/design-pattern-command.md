### Description

A Command is any object that encapsulates all the information necessary to perform an action at a later time. So, instead of invoking a function directly, we create an object representing the intention to perform such an invocation.

Itâ€™s built around four major components that can vary depending on the way we want to implement the pattern:

- Command: The object encapsulating the information necessary to invoke a function.
- Client: This creates the command and provides it to the invoker.
- Invoker: This is responsible for executing the command on the target.
- Target: Subject of the invocation. It can be a lone function or the method of an object.

Using a command pattern has several advantages. Some of them are:

- A command can be scheduled to be run at a later time
- Keeps a history of operations executed in the system
- Can be serialized and sent over the network so can be distributed.
- A command scheduled can be cancelled if not executed yet
